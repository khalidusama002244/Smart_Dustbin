Smart Dustbin
The Smart Dustbin project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller along with ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor to create an intelligent dustbin that opens automatically when someone approaches it. The system detects the presence of objects using ultrasonic sensors and opens the lid accordingly, making it convenient for users to dispose of trash without needing to touch the dustbin.

Features
Automatic lid opening: The dustbin lid opens automatically when an object is detected within a certain range.
Hands-free operation: Users can dispose of trash without needing to touch the dustbin, promoting hygiene.
Adjustable settings: Users can adjust the detection range and lid opening duration according to their preferences.
Low power consumption: The system utilizes efficient components and low-power modes to minimize energy consumption.
Components
ESP32 microcontroller
Ultrasonic distance sensor
Servo motor
Other miscellaneous electronic components (wires, resistors, etc.)
Usage
Power on the Smart Dustbin system.
Approach the dustbin within the specified detection range to trigger the lid opening.
Dispose of trash into the dustbin while the lid is open.
The lid will automatically close after a specified duration or when the object is no longer detected.
